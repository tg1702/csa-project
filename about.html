    <h1>Created for Students, by Students</h1>

    <h2>Thomas Carter</h2>
    <p>I am a full-time computer science student at the University of the West Indies, with a passion for coding, website development, and graphic design. Some unique things about me are that I learned Spanish all the way through CAPE, and I do woodworking on the side where I even won a few awards at NIFCA. Overall, I am always happy to work with others, and this group project was a great learning experience for me.</p>

    <h2>Thelema Grannum</h2>
    <p>About me: I am a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student who enjoys coding, watching superhero movies and (occassionally) playing video games. I have a passion for web development (HTML and JavaScript at least, CSS not so much) and I enjoyed building out the code for this site. I had a great time working with my team and learnt a lot more about web development.</p>

    <h2>Sariah Jackson</h2>
    <p>
        A Vincentian Computer Science and Math major who's tired of Barbados, tired of her degree and tired in general.
    </p>
    <h2>Gavin Pennegan</h2>  
    <p> I am a second-year Computer Science major at The University of The West Indies CaveHill Campus. I love programming, especially game programming. I have years of experience in making games using RPG Maker MV and am happy to contribute my knowledge to the team.</p>
