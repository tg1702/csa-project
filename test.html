        <h1>Test By Gaming</h1>
        <p>Build on your knowledge from the Learn section by playing our game!</p>
        <p>The game will guide you through the process of making your own synchronous counters using D, T and J-K flip-flops</p>
        <p>For further practice, we recommend installing Logisim to build circuits on your own device</p>
        <p>Install Logisim from the COMP2220 course page </p>
        <p><strong>Note that the game only works when run through a server (e.g. Live Server extension in VS Code). Opening the test.html by itself will not work!</strong></p>

        <h1>Game Description</h1>
        <p>Count von Counter is a vampire who (of course) loves to count! But how does he do it in binary? Someone has stolen the Count's car, and has hidden it behind a series of rooms that requires the Count to know how to make a binary counter. Help Count von Counter find his Countmobile by answering a series of questions that will help you build a synchronous counter</p>


        <p>How to play:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select/walk up to the stone tablet to read your question</li>
            <li>Walk through the door corresponding to the correct answer choice</li>
            <li>Sometimes, if you move onto a new question, we will allow you to refer to previous tables for reference. However, after each question it's best that you screenshot an image of the correct solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Controls</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Spacebar- Select/Interact</li>
            <li>Up arrow- Move Up</li>
            <li>Down arrow- Move Down</li>
            <li>Right arrow- Move right</li>
            <li>Left arrow- Move right</li>
        </ul>

        <p>(Alternatively, you can use the mouse to click on any area of the game screen and Count will move to that location)</p>

    <h1>Tips for Playing:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Go through the Learn Section of this site before you attempt to play</li>
        <li>Each of the levels asks you to build out a counter using a specific type of flip-flop, but for practice feel free to create the sequence using a different type of flip-flop. For example, you are encouraged to redo the sequence in Level 1 with T and D flip-flops</li>
        <l1><a href="Circuits/Game.circ" download>Download the completed game circuits</a> (Preferably after you've already completed the level, of course)</l1>
        <li>After each level is completed, go through the Logisim file containing the circuits to make sure you understand everything</li>
        <li>Not optimized for use on tablets or mobile devices</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Recommended browsers:</h1>
