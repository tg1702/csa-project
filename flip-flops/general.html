        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>On completion of this section, you should learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What a flip-flop is</li>
            <li>Uses of flip-flops</li>
        </ul>

       <div class="info">
        <p>A flip flop is a digital device that is able to store a single bit of information, which is represented as a 1 or a 0. Each flip flop has two stable states which are used to store this 1 bit of information and it is able to “flip” between these two states when an input signal is applied, and keeps holds its current state if no input is supplied. As such, flip flops are referred to as <strong>bistable devices</strong>. Flip flops also have both one or more inputs and two outputs Q and Q’, where Q’ is the complement of Q. Often, we denote the current state at time t as Q <sub>t</sub> and the next-state at time t+1 as Q <sub>t+1</sub>. Sometimes, Q <sub>t+1</sub> may also be written as Q<sup>+</sup>. We used both notations interchangeably on the site.</p>
    
       <p>The flip-flop’s operations are controlled by a clock. A clock is an alternating current in a circuit that intermittently pulses between high and low voltages (1 and 0) to synchronize the activities of the other devices in the circuit.</p>

       <p>Flip flops are an essential component in computer memory, and even though they are small, they can be combined to make complex circuits capable of calculations, data storage and more.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Now that we understand what a flip flop is, take a look at the four different types of flip flops: S-R, J-K, T, and D flip flops.
